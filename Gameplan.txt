Pre-processing the data
	-Normalize the features
	  -Scale the features
	  -Flip the data such that it is all going in the same direction
	-Randomly pick top X features based off of feature importance.
	-Pick a subset of features based off of our intuition
	-Say F**k it and just run the models on ALL THE FEATURES
	  -We'll compare these three later once we have the results.
Four Regression Models
	-Linear (Suraj)
	  -The linear model will be our baseline to judge the effectiveness of each other model off of.
	-Random Forests (Kyle)
	-Adaboost (Avi)
	-Neural Net (Billy)
Presentation:
	-Follow the format of the project proposal.
